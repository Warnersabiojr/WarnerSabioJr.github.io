        I'm always actively seeking to incorporate new and different philosophies, methodologies and approaches into my perspective. I believe everything is different and unique, and nothing exists in a vacuum of itself. Three years ago I started an Arts and Technology non-profit called GrowHouse NYC; our mission is to provide a safe and nurturing space for experimentation, creativity, and growth, for disenfranchised, underserved and non-traditional students and youth.  I am earning a certificate in Web Development, at LaGuardia's TechHire Open code program; also I'm currently attaining a Liberal Arts degree from Bard College. I have several years experience in freelance graphic design I aspire to become a UI/UX designer in the future, and I hope to be able to start my own peer mentorship programs in Brooklyn in the future.
